### - Introduction about Hilarity HQ:

A platform for sharing videos, moments, and daily memos. With its user-friendly interface and sleek design, this platform makes sharing your memories with friends and family a breeze.

#### - What I used technologies to build Hilarity HQ?

The important things I used to create Hilarity HQ are (ReactJS v18.2.0, TypeScript 4.9, Material UI v5.11.1, State Management ( ReduxToolkit ), react-oauth/google, jwt-decode, redux-persist, sanity, swr, and more...)

#### - Current Project Focus: Improving User Experience

I am currently focused on enhancing the functionality of this project, including the development of a video search feature and user account management. I am working to improve the user profile page and video detail page, and also adding the ability for users to like and comment on videos. All these efforts are aimed at providing a better overall experience for the users and making it easier for them to discover and interact with videos they enjoy.

#### - Setup and using it:

To install Hilarity HQ to your computer it's easy you can clone it and just type `npm i` to your terminal
Do what you need to add to it or update it or anything you need and update it again
It's so welcomed to work with me to add new features to it
